"""
Unit tests for database connection management module.

Tests connection manager functionality, session handling, retry mechanisms,
and health check operations.

Available fixtures from conftest.py:
- mock_database_config: Provides a MagicMock DatabaseConfig with test values
- mock_async_session: Provides an AsyncMock database session
- mock_connection_manager: Provides a mocked DatabaseConnectionManager
- test_env_vars: Temporarily injects DATABASE_* environment variables via patch.dict
- sample_health_check_results: Provides pre-built HealthCheckResult test data
