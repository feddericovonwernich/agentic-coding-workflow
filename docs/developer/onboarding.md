## Welcome to the Team

Welcome to the Agentic Coding Workflow project! This comprehensive onboarding guide will help you become a productive contributor through a structured 30-day journey.

## Prerequisites Checklist

### Required Tools and Software

- [ ] **Python 3.9+** installed with pip
- [ ] **Git** configured with your name and email
- [ ] **Docker** and Docker Compose for local development
- [ ] **PostgreSQL** client tools (optional, for database debugging)

### Environment Variables

> **ðŸ“š Complete Environment Setup**: For complete environment variable setup instructions, API key creation, and configuration, see the **[Installation Guide - Environment Setup](../getting-started/installation.md#environment-setup)**.

Quick validation that your environment is set up correctly:

```bash
# Verify required environment variables are set
python -c "import os; print('âœ“' if os.getenv('GITHUB_TOKEN') else 'âœ— Missing GITHUB_TOKEN')"
python -c "import os; print('âœ“' if os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY') else 'âœ— Missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')"
python -c "import os; print('âœ“' if os.getenv('DATABASE_URL') else 'âœ— Missing DATABASE_URL')"
```

## First Day Tasks

### 1. Repository Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/feddericovonwernich/agentic-coding-workflow.git
cd agentic-coding-workflow

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development tools
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### 2. Environment Verification

```bash
# Verify Python environment
python --version  # Should be 3.9+
pip list | grep -E "(fastapi|sqlalchemy|anthropic|openai)"

# Verify development tools
ruff --version
mypy --version
pytest --version

# Verify environment variables
python -c "import os; print('âœ“' if os.getenv('GITHUB_TOKEN') else 'âœ— Missing GITHUB_TOKEN')"
```

### 3. Database Setup

```bash
# Start local services
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# Wait for services to be ready
docker-compose ps

# Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Verify database connection
python -c "from src.database import get_session; print('âœ“ Database connected')"
```

### 4. First Successful Test Run

```bash
# Run all tests to verify setup
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test suites
pytest tests/unit/ -v          # Unit tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v   # Integration tests

# Check test coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### 5. First Successful Build

```bash
# Code quality checks
ruff format .        # Format code
ruff check . --fix   # Lint and fix issues
mypy src/           # Type checking

# Security checks
bandit -r src/      # Security linting
safety check        # Dependency vulnerability check

# All checks should pass
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 6. Development Server Verification

```bash
# Start individual workers (in separate terminals)
python -m workers.monitor
python -m workers.analyzer
python -m workers.fixer

# Or start all services
docker-compose up

# Verify services are running
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # API health check
redis-cli ping                     # Redis connectivity
```

```

**Issue**: Database connection failures
```bash
# Solution: Verify Docker services
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs postgres
```

**Issue**: Tests failing on setup
```bash
# Solution: Check environment variables
python -c "import os; print({k:v for k,v in os.environ.items() if 'TOKEN' in k or 'KEY' in k})"
```

### Code Quality
**Issue**: Pre-commit hooks failing
```bash
# Solution: Run individual tools to identify issues
ruff check .
mypy src/
bandit -r src/
```

```

### Git Workflow
**Issue**: Merge conflicts
```bash
# Solution: Rebase against main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

git commit -m "fix: resolve database connection timeout issue"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation for GitHub client"
```
