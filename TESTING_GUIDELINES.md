## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**
   - Focus on what the code should do, not how it does it
   - Test public interfaces and contracts
   - Avoid testing internal implementation details

2. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Every test MUST include Why/What/How documentation
   - Tests serve as living documentation of expected behavior
   - Clear test names that describe scenarios

3. **Independence and Isolation**
   - Each test is completely independent
   - Tests can run in any order
   - No shared state between tests
   - Clean setup and teardown

4. **Fast Feedback Loop**
   - Unit tests provide immediate feedback (< 1 second)
   - Integration tests validate real behavior (< 10 seconds)
   - Quick test execution enables rapid development

5. **Comprehensive Error Coverage**
   - Test both success and failure paths
   - Validate error handling and recovery
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions

### Testing Pyramid Strategy

```

**Distribution Guidelines:**
- **70% Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated testing with mocked dependencies
- **30% Integration Tests**: Testing with actual PostgreSQL database using testcontainers

## Test Structure and Organization

### Naming Conventions

Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the scenario:

```python
# Good: Describes the exact scenario being tested
def test_get_prs_by_repository_excludes_draft_prs_by_default()
def test_create_pull_request_raises_error_for_duplicate_number()
def test_analyze_check_failure_categorizes_lint_errors_correctly()
def test_github_client_retries_on_rate_limit_with_backoff()

# Bad: Vague or unclear purpose
def test_get_prs()
def test_create_pr()
def test_analyze()
def test_client_retry()
```

### Test Organization by Feature

Organize tests in classes by feature or component:

```python
class TestPullRequestCreation:
    """Tests for pull request creation scenarios."""
    
    async def test_create_with_minimal_required_data(self):
        """Test creating PR with only required fields."""
        
    async def test_create_with_full_optional_data(self):
        """Test creating PR with all optional fields."""
        
    async def test_create_validates_pr_number_uniqueness(self):
        """Test that duplicate PR numbers are rejected."""

class TestPullRequestQueries:
    """Tests for pull request query operations."""
    
    async def test_get_by_repository_filters_by_state(self):
        """Test filtering PRs by state (open/closed/merged)."""
        
    async def test_get_recent_prs_respects_time_boundaries(self):
        """Test that recent PR queries use correct date ranges."""
```

## Documentation Requirements

### Mandatory Why/What/How Pattern

Every test MUST include comprehensive docstring documentation:

```python
def test_analyzer_categorizes_lint_failures():
    """
    Why: Ensure the analyzer correctly identifies lint failures to route them
         for automatic fixing rather than human escalation. Proper categorization
         is critical for determining the appropriate fix strategy.
    
    What: Tests that CheckAnalyzer.analyze() returns category='lint' for
          eslint failure logs and includes confidence score above threshold.
    
    How: Provides sample eslint failure logs with typical error patterns,
         calls the analyzer, and verifies the returned analysis has correct
         category, confidence score >= 0.8, and suggested fix strategy.
    """
    # Test implementation here
```

### Documentation Template

Use this template for all tests:

```python
def test_feature_scenario_condition():
    """
    Why: [Business reason why this test exists - what problem does it prevent?
         What confidence does it provide? Why is this behavior important?]
    
    What: [Specific functionality being tested - exact inputs and expected outputs.
          What methods/functions are called? What state changes are expected?]
    
    How: [Testing approach and methodology - how is the test structured?
         What test data is used? How are assertions validated?]
    """
    # Test implementation
```

## Unit Testing Guidelines

### When to Use Unit Tests (70% of tests)

- Testing business logic and validation rules
- Repository methods with mocked database sessions
- Model behavior and state transitions
- Error handling and edge cases
- Pure functions and calculations

### Mocking Strategies

Use consistent patterns for mocking dependencies:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_github_client() -> AsyncMock:
    """Provide mock GitHub client for testing."""
    client = AsyncMock()
    client.get_pull_request = AsyncMock()
    client.list_check_runs = AsyncMock()
    client.rate_limiter = AsyncMock()
    return client

@pytest.fixture
def mock_database_session() -> AsyncMock:
    """Provide mock database session for repository testing."""
    session = AsyncMock()
    session.execute = AsyncMock()
    session.get = AsyncMock()
    session.add = AsyncMock()
    session.flush = AsyncMock()
    session.commit = AsyncMock()
    session.rollback = AsyncMock()
    return session

# Helper functions for consistent mock setup
def setup_mock_query_result(session: AsyncMock, return_value: Any) -> None:
    """Setup mock session to return specific query result."""
    mock_result = MagicMock()
    mock_result.scalar_one_or_none.return_value = return_value
    session.execute.return_value = mock_result

def setup_mock_list_result(session: AsyncMock, return_list: List[Any]) -> None:
    """Setup mock session to return list of results."""
    mock_result = MagicMock()
    mock_scalars = MagicMock()
    mock_scalars.all.return_value = return_list
    mock_result.scalars.return_value = mock_scalars
    session.execute.return_value = mock_result
```

### Unit Test Example

```python
async def test_pull_request_repository_creates_with_valid_data():
    """
    Why: Ensure the repository correctly creates PR records with valid data
         and properly handles database session operations for consistency.
    
    What: Tests that PullRequestRepository.create() successfully creates a PR
          with required fields and returns the created instance with ID.
    
    How: Mocks database session, calls create with valid PR data, verifies
         session methods are called correctly and returned PR has expected values.
    """
    # Arrange
    mock_session = AsyncMock()
    repository = PullRequestRepository(mock_session)
    
    pr_data = create_test_pull_request_data(
        repository_id=uuid.uuid4(),
        pr_number=123,
        title="Test PR",
        author="testuser"
    )
    
    # Mock the created PR that would be returned from database
    created_pr = PullRequest(id=uuid.uuid4(), **pr_data)
    mock_session.flush = AsyncMock()
    mock_session.refresh = AsyncMock()
    
    # Act
    result = await repository.create(**pr_data)
    
    # Assert
    mock_session.add.assert_called_once()
    mock_session.flush.assert_called_once()
    mock_session.refresh.assert_called_once()
    
    # Verify the created PR has expected properties
    assert result.pr_number == 123
    assert result.title == "Test PR"
    assert result.author == "testuser"
    assert result.state == PRState.OPENED  # Default state
```

## Integration Testing Guidelines

### When to Use Integration Tests (30% of tests)

- Testing with actual PostgreSQL database using testcontainers
- Complex queries with actual data relationships
- Transaction behavior and rollback scenarios
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Performance validation with realistic data

### Integration Database Testing

Use testcontainers for integration tests:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_pull_request_crud_operations_with_real_database():
    """
    Why: Verify that PR CRUD operations work correctly with real PostgreSQL
         database including constraints, triggers, and transaction handling.
    
    What: Tests complete lifecycle of creating, reading, updating, and deleting
          a pull request using actual database operations.
    
    How: Uses testcontainer PostgreSQL, creates real PR record, performs CRUD
         operations, and verifies data persistence and constraint enforcement.
    """
    async with async_session_factory() as session:
        repository = PullRequestRepository(session)
        
        # Create
        original_pr = await repository.create(
            repository_id=uuid.uuid4(),
            pr_number=123,
            title="Integration Test PR",
            author="testuser",
            body="Test description"
        )
        await session.commit()
        
        assert original_pr.id is not None
        assert original_pr.created_at is not None
        
        # Read
        found_pr = await repository.get_by_id(original_pr.id)
        assert found_pr is not None
        assert found_pr.title == "Integration Test PR"
        assert found_pr.pr_number == 123
        
        # Update
        updated_pr = await repository.update(
            found_pr, 
            title="Updated Integration Test PR",
            body="Updated description"
        )
        await session.commit()
        
        assert updated_pr.title == "Updated Integration Test PR"
        assert updated_pr.body == "Updated description"
        assert updated_pr.updated_at > updated_pr.created_at
        
        # Delete
        success = await repository.delete_by_id(original_pr.id)
        await session.commit()
        
        assert success is True
        
        # Verify deletion
        deleted_pr = await repository.get_by_id(original_pr.id)
        assert deleted_pr is None
```

### Transaction Testing

Test rollback and transaction boundaries:

```python
async def test_transaction_rollback_on_constraint_violation():
    """
    Why: Ensure database transactions are properly rolled back when constraint
         violations occur, maintaining data consistency and preventing partial updates.
    
    What: Tests that attempting to create duplicate PR numbers triggers rollback
          and leaves database in consistent state with original data intact.
    
    How: Creates initial PR, commits, then attempts duplicate creation in new
         transaction, verifies exception is raised and original data is preserved.
    """
    async with async_session_factory() as session:
        repository = PullRequestRepository(session)
        repository_id = uuid.uuid4()
        
        # Create initial PR
        original_pr = await repository.create(
            repository_id=repository_id,
            pr_number=123,
            title="Original PR",
            author="user1"
        )
        await session.commit()
        
        # Attempt to create duplicate in new session
        async with async_session_factory() as new_session:
            new_repository = PullRequestRepository(new_session)
            
            with pytest.raises(IntegrityError):
                await new_repository.create(
                    repository_id=repository_id,
                    pr_number=123,  # Duplicate number
                    title="Duplicate PR",
                    author="user2"
                )
                await new_session.commit()
        
        # Verify original data is intact
        async with async_session_factory() as verify_session:
            verify_repository = PullRequestRepository(verify_session)
            found_pr = await verify_repository.get_by_id(original_pr.id)
            
            assert found_pr is not None
            assert found_pr.title == "Original PR"
            assert found_pr.author == "user1"
```

## Test Data Management

### Factory Patterns

Create reusable factories for consistent test data:

```python
def create_test_repository_data(**overrides) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Factory for test repository data.
    
    Provides realistic default values that can be overridden for specific tests.
    """
    defaults = {
        "url": f"https://github.com/test-org/test-repo-{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}",
        "name": f"test-repo-{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}",
        "full_name": f"test-org/test-repo-{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}",
        "status": RepositoryStatus.ACTIVE,
        "polling_interval_minutes": 15,
        "failure_count": 0,
        "last_checked_at": datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(minutes=5)
    }
    defaults.update(overrides)
    return defaults

def create_test_pull_request_data(repository_id: uuid.UUID, **overrides) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Factory for test pull request data."""
    defaults = {
        "repository_id": repository_id,
        "pr_number": random.randint(1, 9999),
        "title": f"Test PR {uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}",
        "body": f"Test PR description {uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}",
        "author": f"testuser{random.randint(1, 999)}",
        "head_sha": f"abc{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}def",
        "base_sha": f"xyz{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}123",
        "state": PRState.OPENED,
        "draft": False
    }
    defaults.update(overrides)
    return defaults

def create_test_check_run_data(pr_id: uuid.UUID, **overrides) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Factory for test check run data."""
    defaults = {
        "pr_id": pr_id,
        "external_id": f"check-{uuid.uuid4().hex[:12]}",
        "check_name": f"test-check-{random.choice(['lint', 'test', 'build'])}",
        "status": CheckStatus.COMPLETED,
        "conclusion": random.choice(list(CheckConclusion)),
        "started_at": datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(minutes=2),
        "completed_at": datetime.utcnow(),
    }
    defaults.update(overrides)
    return defaults
```

### Unique Test Data

Ensure test data uniqueness to prevent conflicts:

```python
def test_create_multiple_pull_requests_with_unique_data():
    """
    Why: Verify that multiple PRs can be created within the same repository
         without conflicts when using unique PR numbers.
    
    What: Tests creating 3 different PRs in the same repository with
          unique PR numbers and validates all are stored correctly.
    
    How: Uses factory pattern to generate unique data for each PR,
         creates them sequentially, and verifies all have distinct IDs.
    """
    repository_id = uuid.uuid4()
    created_prs = []
    
    for i in range(3):
        pr_data = create_test_pull_request_data(
            repository_id=repository_id,
            pr_number=i + 100,  # Ensure unique PR numbers
            title=f"PR {i + 1} - {uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"  # Unique titles
        )
        
        pr = await repository.create(**pr_data)
        created_prs.append(pr)
    
    # Verify all PRs were created with unique IDs
    pr_ids = [pr.id for pr in created_prs]
    assert len(set(pr_ids)) == 3  # All IDs are unique
    
    # Verify PR numbers are as expected
    pr_numbers = [pr.pr_number for pr in created_prs]
    assert pr_numbers == [100, 101, 102]
```

### Realistic Test Data

Use realistic data that matches production patterns:

```python
# Good: Realistic GitHub-style data
def create_realistic_pull_request():
    return create_test_pull_request_data(
        repository_id=uuid.uuid4(),
        pr_number=1547,
        title="Fix: Handle null pointer exception in PR analyzer (#1540)",
        body="""This PR fixes a critical bug where the PR analyzer crashes when 
        encountering null values in check run metadata.
        
        Changes:
        - Add null checks in CheckRunAnalyzer.analyze()
        - Update error handling to log context information
        - Add regression tests for null metadata scenarios
        
        Fixes #1540""",
        author="developer123",
        head_sha="a1b2c3d4e5f6789",
        base_sha="z9y8x7w6v5u4321",
        state=PRState.OPENED
    )

# Bad: Artificial, unrealistic test data
def create_artificial_pull_request():
    return create_test_pull_request_data(
        repository_id=uuid.uuid4(),
        pr_number=1,
        title="test",
        body="test description",
        author="user"
    )
```

## Assertion Standards

### Specific Assertions

Use specific assertions with helpful error messages:

```python
# Good: Specific assertions that provide clear feedback
def test_pull_request_state_transitions():
    """Test valid and invalid PR state transitions."""
    
    pr = create_test_pull_request(state=PRState.OPENED)
    
    # Test valid transitions
    assert pr.can_transition_to(PRState.CLOSED) is True, \
        "Open PR should be able to transition to closed"
    assert pr.can_transition_to(PRState.MERGED) is True, \
        "Open PR should be able to transition to merged"
    
    # Test state after transition
    pr.state = PRState.MERGED
    assert pr.state == PRState.MERGED, \
        "PR state should be updated to merged"
    
    # Test invalid transitions after merge
    assert pr.can_transition_to(PRState.OPENED) is False, \
        "Merged PR should not be able to reopen"
    assert pr.can_transition_to(PRState.CLOSED) is False, \
        "Merged PR should not be able to transition to closed"

# Bad: Generic assertions without context
def test_pr_transitions():
    pr = create_test_pull_request()
    assert pr.can_transition_to(PRState.CLOSED)  # No context
    assert pr.state  # Too generic
    pr.state = PRState.MERGED
    assert not pr.can_transition_to(PRState.OPENED)  # Unclear why
```

### Multiple Assertion Strategies

Test multiple aspects with clear grouping:

```python
def test_github_client_rate_limit_handling():
    """
    Why: Ensure GitHub client properly handles rate limit responses and
         implements appropriate backoff strategies to prevent API abuse.
    
    What: Tests that rate limit errors trigger exponential backoff,
          rate limit information is tracked, and requests succeed after reset.
    
    How: Mocks GitHub API responses with rate limit headers, verifies
         client behavior matches expected backoff patterns and tracking.
    """
    # Setup rate limit scenario
    mock_response = create_rate_limit_response(
        limit=5000,
        remaining=0,
        reset_time=int(time.time()) + 60
    )
    
    with pytest.raises(GitHubRateLimitError) as exc_info:
        await github_client.get_pull_request("owner", "repo", 123)
    
    # Verify exception details
    error = exc_info.value
    assert error.status_code == 429, "Rate limit error should have 429 status"
    assert error.reset_time > time.time(), "Reset time should be in the future"
    assert "rate limit exceeded" in str(error).lower(), \
        "Error message should mention rate limiting"
    
    # Verify rate limit tracking
    rate_limit_info = github_client.rate_limiter.get_rate_limit("core")
    assert rate_limit_info is not None, "Rate limit info should be tracked"
    assert rate_limit_info.limit == 5000, "Limit should match API response"
    assert rate_limit_info.remaining == 0, "Remaining should be zero"
    assert rate_limit_info.reset == mock_response.reset_time, \
        "Reset time should match API response"
```

## Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage Thresholds

- **Overall project coverage**: 80% minimum
- **New code coverage**: 90% minimum
- **Critical path coverage**: 95% minimum

### Coverage Configuration

Configure pytest-cov for meaningful coverage reporting:

```python
# pyproject.toml
[tool.coverage.run]
source = ["src"]
omit = [
    "*/tests/*",
    "*/migrations/*", 
    "*/__pycache__/*",
    "*/venv/*",
    "*/.venv/*"
]

[tool.coverage.report]
exclude_lines = [
    "pragma: no cover",
    "def __repr__",
    "if self.debug:",
    "if settings.DEBUG",
    "raise AssertionError",
    "raise NotImplementedError",
    "if 0:",
    "if __name__ == .__main__.:",
    "class .*\\bProtocol\\):",
    "@(abc\\.)?abstractmethod",
]
precision = 2
show_missing = true
fail_under = 80
```

### Critical Path Coverage

Ensure critical functionality has comprehensive coverage:

```python
# Example: Critical path testing for PR processing
def test_complete_pr_processing_workflow():
    """
    Why: Verify the entire PR processing workflow functions correctly
         from detection through analysis to fix application.
    
    What: Tests the complete flow: detect new PR -> analyze checks ->
          categorize failures -> apply fixes -> update status.
    
    How: Creates realistic PR with failed checks, processes through
         each workflow stage, and validates state transitions and outputs.
    """
    # This test covers the critical path and should have comprehensive coverage
    pass
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run only unit tests (fast)
pytest tests/unit/ -v -m unit

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v -m integration

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing

# Run tests in parallel (with pytest-xdist)
pytest tests/ -n auto

# Run only failed tests from last run
pytest tests/ --lf

# Run specific test patterns
pytest tests/ -k "test_pull_request"

# Generate coverage report

# Open htmlcov/index.html in browser
```

## Performance Testing

### Basic Performance Validation

Include timing validation in integration tests:

```python
import time

async def test_repository_query_performance():
    """
    Why: Ensure repository queries meet performance requirements
         to maintain responsive user experience and prevent timeouts.
    
    What: Tests that common repository queries complete within acceptable
          time limits under normal load conditions.
    
    How: Measures execution time for typical query operations and
         validates against established performance thresholds.
    """
    # Setup test data
    repository_id = uuid.uuid4() 
    for i in range(50):  # Create realistic data volume
        await pr_repository.create(**create_test_pull_request_data(repository_id))
    
    # Measure query performance
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    results = await pr_repository.get_by_repository(
        repository_id, 
        limit=20,
        state=PRState.OPENED
    )
    end_time = time.perf_counter()
    
    query_time = end_time - start_time
    
    # Validate performance
    assert len(results) <= 20, "Should respect limit parameter"
    assert query_time < 0.100, f"Query took {query_time:.3f}s, should be < 100ms"
    
    # Validate results are correct
    assert all(pr.state == PRState.OPENED for pr in results), \
        "All returned PRs should be in opened state"
```

## Error Scenario Testing

### Exception Testing Patterns

Test expected exceptions with proper validation:

```python
async def test_repository_handles_constraint_violations():
    """
    Why: Ensure repository gracefully handles database constraint violations
         and provides meaningful error information for debugging and recovery.
    
    What: Tests that unique constraint violations raise appropriate exceptions
          with clear error messages and proper error categorization.
    
    How: Creates conflicting data that violates unique constraints,
         attempts database operations, and validates exception handling.
    """
    repository_id = uuid.uuid4()
    
    # Create initial PR
    await pr_repository.create(
        repository_id=repository_id,
        pr_number=123,
        title="Original PR",
        author="user1"
    )
    
    # Attempt to create duplicate
    with pytest.raises(IntegrityError) as exc_info:
        await pr_repository.create(
            repository_id=repository_id,
            pr_number=123,  # Duplicate number
            title="Duplicate PR", 
            author="user2"
        )
    
    # Validate exception details
    error = exc_info.value
    assert "unique constraint" in str(error).lower(), \
        "Error should mention constraint violation"
    assert "pr_number" in str(error).lower(), \
        "Error should indicate which field caused the violation"
```

### Error Recovery Testing

Test system behavior under failure conditions:

```python
async def test_github_client_recovers_from_network_errors():
    """
    Why: Ensure GitHub client can recover from transient network failures
         without losing data or leaving the system in an inconsistent state.
    
    What: Tests that network timeouts and connection errors trigger proper
          retry logic with exponential backoff and eventual success.
    
    How: Simulates network failures using mock exceptions, verifies retry
         attempts follow expected patterns, and validates final success.
    """
    # Setup mock to fail twice then succeed
    mock_responses = [
        aiohttp.ClientError("Connection timeout"),
        aiohttp.ClientError("Connection reset"),
        {"id": 123, "title": "Test PR"}  # Success on third attempt
    ]
    
    github_client._session.get.side_effect = mock_responses
    
    # Should succeed after retries
    result = await github_client.get_pull_request("owner", "repo", 123)
    
    # Verify result
    assert result["id"] == 123
    assert result["title"] == "Test PR"
    
    # Verify retry attempts
    assert github_client._session.get.call_count == 3, \
        "Should have made 3 attempts (2 failures + 1 success)"
```
