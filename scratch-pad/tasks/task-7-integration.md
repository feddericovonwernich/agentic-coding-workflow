# Task 7: Integration and Optimization

## Objective
Integrate all components of the PR Monitor Worker and optimize for the performance requirements of processing 100 repositories with 1000 PRs each within a 5-minute window.

## Requirements
- Wire together all components (processor, discovery, detection, synchronization)
- Optimize for performance requirements
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Ensure proper resource cleanup

## Implementation Details

### Integration Points
1. **Component Wiring**:
   - Connect PRProcessor with all services
   - Configure dependency injection
   - Set up proper initialization sequence
   - Handle service lifecycle management

2. **Configuration Management**:
   - Create configuration for processing limits
   - Set concurrent processing parameters
   - Configure retry policies
   - Define timeout values

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Profile code to identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize database queries with proper indexes
   - Tune concurrent processing limits
   - Implement request batching where beneficial

4. **Resource Management**:
   - Ensure proper cleanup of connections
   - Handle memory efficiently for large datasets
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add resource monitoring

5. **Monitoring & Observability**:
   - Add structured logging throughout
   - Implement metrics collection
   - Add performance counters
   - Create health check endpoints

## Configuration Schema
```python
@dataclass
class ProcessorConfig:
    max_concurrent_repositories: int = 10
    max_concurrent_prs_per_repo: int = 50
    github_request_timeout: int = 30
    database_transaction_timeout: int = 60
    enable_caching: bool = True
    cache_ttl_seconds: int = 300
    retry_max_attempts: int = 3
    retry_backoff_factor: float = 2.0
```

## Performance Targets
- Process 100 repositories in < 5 minutes
- Handle 1000 PRs per repository
- Minimize GitHub API calls through caching
- Maintain < 1GB memory usage during processing
- Support graceful degradation under load

## Testing Requirements
- End-to-end integration tests
- Load testing with realistic data volumes
- Performance benchmarking
- Resource leak detection
- Stress testing with API failures

## Monitoring Metrics
- Processing time per repository
- Number of API calls made
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Database transaction times
- Error rates by type
- Memory usage patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] End-to-end processing works correctly
- [ ] Meets performance requirements (100 repos, 1000 PRs each, 5-minute window)
- [ ] Proper resource cleanup and connection management
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] Integration tests passing
